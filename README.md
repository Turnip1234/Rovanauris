# FAQ:
- Q: Why the hell is it called Rovanauris?
- A: That's for you to find out
- Q: Why no OptiFine?
- A: Redistributing OptiFine is illegal, and besides, in this modpack it is a huge detriment to performance and it causes many, many bugs. Sorry, no shaders.
- Q: My game crashed what do I do?
- A: Get the crash report, and upload it to a service like [Hastebin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/). Use this to ask for help, otherwise we have no idea what happened.
- Q: I found an exploit, or a mod that dominates other mods. Where do I report it?
- A: You don't! Literally just don't exploit it, this modpack is for fun, and we gave up removing every possible exploit long ago. If cheesing the game with an exploit isn't for you, just don't do it.
